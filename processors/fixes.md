Let's prioritize the fixes based on impact and dependencies. Here's the recommended order:

## Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Critical Infrastructure)

### 1. Fix Japanese Character Encoding
**Priority**: Critical - blocks all Japanese functionality
**Files**: `japanese_processor.py`
**Tasks**:
- Replace corrupted UTF-8 characters in `_simple_romanization` mapping
- Add proper Unicode validation for input text
- Test with actual Japanese characters

### 2. Add Input Validation & Error Handling
**Priority**: Critical - prevents crashes
**Files**: All processors
**Tasks**:
- Validate image files exist and are readable
- Check text inputs for encoding issues
- Standardize exception handling (raise vs return None)
- Add consistent logging levels

### 3. Create Shared Processing Context
**Priority**: High - improves performance significantly
**Files**: New `processing_context.py`
**Tasks**:
- Single image loading/preprocessing pipeline
- Shared configuration and engine instances
- Memory management for large documents

## Phase 2: Core Logic Simplification

### 4. Simplify Content Extractor Classification
**Priority**: High - current logic is fragile
**Files**: `content_extractor.py`
**Tasks**:
- Replace 9-metric scoring with 3-4 robust indicators
- Use relative thresholds instead of hardcoded values
- Add confidence bands instead of binary classification
- Remove complex morphological operations

### 5. Improve OCR Engine Selection
**Priority**: High - affects quality significantly  
**Files**: `ocr_processor.py`
**Tasks**:
- Content-aware engine selection (Japanese text â†’ EasyOCR preference)
- Remove text length bonuses from scoring
- Add engine-specific quality metrics
- Handle engine initialization failures gracefully

## Phase 3: Architecture Improvements

### 6. Separate Processor Concerns
**Priority**: Medium - improves maintainability
**Files**: All processors
**Tasks**:
- Move classification logic from Content Extractor to OCR Processor
- Split Japanese Processor into character handling + semantic analysis
- Remove HTML generation from multiple processors (centralize in reconstructor)

### 7. Optimize Processing Pipeline
**Priority**: Medium - performance improvement
**Files**: All processors
**Tasks**:
- Reuse OCR engine instances across documents
- Implement progressive image processing (don't reprocess same regions)
- Add early exit conditions for low-confidence regions

## Phase 4: Quality & Robustness

### 8. Fix Page Reconstructor Layout Issues
**Priority**: Medium - affects output quality
**Files**: `page_reconstructor.py`
**Tasks**:
- Add responsive CSS for varied document layouts
- Implement proper HTML escaping
- Create template system for different document types
- Fix confidence indicator positioning

### 9. Enhance Japanese Processing Robustness
**Priority**: Medium - important for domain
**Files**: `japanese_processor.py`
**Tasks**:
- Expand martial arts dictionary (currently only 20 terms)
- Add MeCab version compatibility checks
- Improve segment boundary detection
- Handle mixed script text better

### 10. Add Comprehensive Testing
**Priority**: Low - but important for maintenance
**Files**: New test files
**Tasks**:
- Unit tests for each processor's core functions
- Integration tests with sample documents
- Performance benchmarks
- Error condition testing

## Implementation Strategy

**Week 1**: Focus on Phase 1 (Foundation) - these fixes enable everything else
**Week 2**: Phase 2 (Core Logic) - these provide the biggest quality improvements  
**Week 3**: Phase 3 (Architecture) - these make the system maintainable
**Week 4**: Phase 4 (Polish) - these improve user experience

## Risk Mitigation

- Keep original processors as backup during refactoring
- Test each phase with sample Draeger documents before proceeding
- Implement feature flags for new logic (fallback to old methods if needed)
- Document confidence score changes since they affect academic validation

This order addresses the most critical issues first while building a foundation for the more complex architectural changes. The Japanese encoding fix is essential since it currently breaks the core functionality for your domain.
